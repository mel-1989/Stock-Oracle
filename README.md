# Stock-Oracle:
A sophisticated machine learning framework for predicting stock market movements using historical price data. Future plans to leverage technical indicators and sentiment analysis from financial news.

# Overview:
StockSage combines multiple ML models including LSTM networks and gradient boosting to forecast stock prices across different time horizons. The system processes real-time market data along with social sentiment to generate trading signals and price predictions.
#Key Features:
- Multi-model ensemble approach combining deep learning and traditional ML algorithms
- Real-time processing of market data and technical indicators
- Customizable prediction horizons from intraday to long-term forecasts
- Comprehensive testing framework with performance metrics
- locally hosted web visualization system with customization options

# Coming Soon:
- Natural language processing of financial news and social media sentiment
- inclusion of technical indicators to increase accuracy

# Getting Started
StockSage is designed to get you up and running with minimal setup. Follow these steps to start predicting market movements:
Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stocksage.git
cd stocksage
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the Models
Run the automated training pipeline by specifying your target stock symbols:
python auto.py --symbols AAPL MSFT GOOGL
This will:
- Download historical data for the specified symbols
- Process data automatically and begin the to train the ensemble of ML models
- optimize the model structure iteratively
- Save the trained models

The training process typically takes 15-30 minutes per symbol on a modern CPU. GPU acceleration is supported and will significantly reduce training time.
3. Launch the Visualization Dashboard
Start the web interface to explore predictions and model insights:

- cd dashboard
- npm install
- npm start
- 
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the dashboard. You'll see real-time predictions, model performance metrics, and interactive visualizations of market trends.
That's it! The system will automatically update predictions as new market data becomes available. Check out our Documentation for advanced configuration options and API usage.
